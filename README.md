## Description

This is my personal portfolio website including a client-side frontend and an admin-side headless CMS. Created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Keystone 6](https://keystonejs.com/).
The web app is inspired by this [tutorial](https://keystonejs.com/docs/walkthroughs/embedded-mode-with-sqlite-nextjs) created by Keystone.js demonstrating Keystone.js in embeded mode.  

Access the live web at [https://manphamquang.vercel.app/](https://manphamquang.vercel.app/)

## To get started
First clone the project, then run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the frontend result.  
Open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the headless CMS admin UI.
